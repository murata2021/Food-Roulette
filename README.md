# Food-Roulette

Food Roulette is my capstone one project for my software engineering bootcamp with Springboard. It is a web application that helps its  users’ decision making processes on what to eat & where to eat. It is hosted on https://food-roulette-2021.herokuapp.com/

## Project Proposal

## Navigation
Here the general process for a user:

1.	Without signup and login users will be able to use the search bar to search meals in the database. User will be able to view the single meal and its ingredients. To see/write/like reviews users have to be logged in. 
2.	Sign-up or login to the food roulette. It’ll prompt you on the home page. On the home page there are three options for users to proceed. 
3.	User will be able to pick their random food from selected category, selected cuisine or in a totally random way from all meals in the database. After they select the option they want a random meal will appear on their screen. The user will pass it or like it. If they pass it, another meal will pop out on their screen. 
4.	Liked meal will be added to the database. When user like the meal, based on their location preference, restaurants that serve this meal will be displayed.
5.	User will be able to see each restaurant’s details. 
6.	User can like the restaurants or he/she can move on.
7.	After user like meal or meal&restaurant together, he/she will be able to write review. 
8.	Each individual user will have their own user pages. User pages have four contents. User own reviews, user favorite meals, user favorite restaurants, reviews that user found useful. 
9.	At anytime, users will be able to remove restaurants, meals from their favorite list.
